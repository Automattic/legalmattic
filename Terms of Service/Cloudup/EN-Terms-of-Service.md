Last Updated: February 20, 2013

WELCOME TO CLOUDUP WHICH IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY AUTOMATTIC, INC. (“CLOUDUP”, “WE”, “US” or “OUR”). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE (THESE “TERMS”) CAREFULLY.

BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE, PURCHASING SERVICES OR CLICKING AT THE TIME OF YOUR REGISTRATION FOR THE SERVICES, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT WITH CLOUDUP AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.

These Terms apply to your access to and use of Cloudup.com and any related websites (collectively, the “Site”) and Cloudup’s services, applications and features (collectively, the “Services”). If you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Cloudup for violations of these Terms.

These Terms contain provisions that govern how claims that you and Cloudup have against each other are resolved (see Dispute Resolution section). These Terms also contain provisions requiring you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court. If you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.

Cloudup reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms (or any policy or guideline of Cloudup) at any time and in its sole discretion by providing notice that these Terms have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an e-mail, by posting a notice on the Site, by posting the revised Terms on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms or by such other form of notice as determined by Cloudup. Any changes or modification will be effective 30 days after providing notice that these Terms have been modified (the “Notice Period”). Your continued use of the Services following the Notice Period will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Therefore, you should review these Terms whenever you access the Services and at least every 30 days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.

The previous amendment to these Terms was effective on February 20, 2013. Please visit our policy updates page, available at https://cloudup.com/privacy-policy for a list of past Terms and a summary of important changes that have been made to these Terms since the previous version.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable law, Cloudup has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Cloudup’s sole discretion, subscribers or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Cloudup may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Services and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

####Copyright Complaints

If you are a copyright owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of one, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through Cloudup Services by completing the following DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement and delivering it to Cloudup’s Designated Copyright Agent. You should note that if you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.

* Identify the material that you claim is infringing (or to be the subject of infringing activity) and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL of the link shown on Cloudup Site or location in the Services where such material may be found.
* Provide your mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address.
* Include both of the following statements in the body of the Notice: (a) "I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law (e.g., as a fair use)"; and (b) "I hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that is allegedly infringed."

###Dispute Resolution

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH CLOUDUP AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
You and Cloudup agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Services, except that you and Cloudup are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

You and Cloudup agree (a) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco County, California; (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (d) that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Cloudup will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (“opt-out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) at 60 29th St. #343, San Francisco, CA, 94110 within 30 after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number and the e-mail address used to log into your account. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply.

###General

Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Cloudup reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Services and to block or prevent future your access to and use of the Services.

If any provision of these Terms is be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, Cloudup may choose to electronically deliver all communications with you, which may include: (a) e-mail to your e-mail address indicated in your communications with Cloudup or upon registration for the Services; or (b) posting messages that are displayed to you when you log in to or access the Services. Cloudup’s electronic communications to you may transmit or convey information about action taken on your request, portions of your request that may be incomplete or require additional explanation, any notices with respect to modifications to these Terms, any notices required under applicable law and any other notices. You agree to do business electronically with Cloudup, and to receive electronically all current and future notices, disclosures, communications and information, and that the aforementioned provided electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
