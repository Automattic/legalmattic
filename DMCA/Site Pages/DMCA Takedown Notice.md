If you believe that material available on our sites, including those hosted at WordPress.com, infringes on your copyright(s), please notify us by submitting a DMCA notice. After we receive a valid and complete notice, we will remove the material and make a good faith attempt to contact the user who uploaded the material by email.

Please note that we are unable to process DMCA notices that refer to sites hosted on third party servers that use the self-hosted WordPress.org software. Please refer to: [http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/](http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/) for more information on the differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org.

WordPress.com is a publishing platform where bloggers often use copyrighted materials in commentary or journalism, or transform the materials into something original. As such, before submitting a DMCA notice, it’s important to consider if the manner in which the material is used falls under **[fair use](http://en.support.wordpress.com/fair-use/)**. If you are not sure whether material located on a WordPress.com site infringes your copyright, or if it is subject to fair use protections, you should first consider seeking legal advice.

**You may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity infringes your copyright. ****We have and will [highlight such abuses](https://transparency.automattic.com/tag/hall-of-shame) and [seek to collect those damages](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8175491/wordpress-automattic-wins-dmca-takedown-straight-pride-uk-case).**  **In addition, you are required to consider the possible fair use implications, as a result of [Lenz v. Universal](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit). We reserve the right to challenge abuses of the DMCA process, and your use of this form does not waive that right.**

**Your DMCA notice will be forwarded to the party that made the material available, and also may be sent to third parties such as **[**LumenDatabase.org**](http://www.lumendatabase.org/)**. A note will also be placed on the site in question detailing the name of the copyright owner who submitted the takedown notice.**

Please follow these steps to file a notice:

1. **Verify that the blog in question is hosted by Automattic.** We have no control over blogs that say "Powered by WordPress." Those blogs use the open source WordPress.org software and are not hosted by us. Please contact the appropriate web host with complaints. We only host blogs that have "wordpress.com" in their URL or that say "Blog at WordPress.**com**" on the site.
2. **Contact the blogger directly.** Go to the blog post in question and leave a comment with your complaint to see if the matter can be resolved directly between you and the blogger.
3. **Send your complaint to our designated agent via the form below**, if the issue cannot be resolved directly with the blogger.

As required by the DMCA, we have a policy to terminate users and/or sites that we consider to be repeat infringers. Although we won’t share the specifics of our repeat infringer policy (we don't want anyone to game the system, after all), we believe that it strikes the right balance: it protects the rights of copyright owners and protects legitimate users from wrongful termination. Please note that notices that are successfully countered, rejected on fair use grounds, or deemed to be fraudulent are not counted against a user or site.
