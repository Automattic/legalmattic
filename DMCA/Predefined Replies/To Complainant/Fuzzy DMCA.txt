Hello,

After reviewing your notice and the material you claim to be infringing, we are concerned that your complaint may not properly fall under the DMCA. Please note that Section 107 of the copyright law identifies various purposes for which the reproduction of a particular work may be considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research:

Please note that you may be liable for damages if you “knowingly materially misrepresent” your copyrights – and we may seek to collect those damages:

If you believe your copyright has been infringed upon, we ask you to please explain in greater detail why you think so. Answering these questions in particular may help us evaluate your claim:

* Why and how is your work used? Is the use transformative?
* How much of your work is used? e.g., is your work being used in its entirety, or just a small portion?
* How is the market for or value of your work affected by this use?

Thank you,
